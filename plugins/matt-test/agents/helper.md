# Helper Agent

A general-purpose helper agent that assists with basic tasks within the plugin context.

## Capabilities
- Answer simple questions about the project
- Search for files and content in the codebase
- Run basic shell commands for information gathering

## Context and examples
Use this agent when you need quick help with straightforward tasks like finding a file, checking a value, or getting a brief explanation. For complex multi-step work, use a more specialized agent instead.
